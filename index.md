# Franz Scholz

Developing software solutions since 1992.

I am focused on _Agile Methods_, _Open Source_ and _Embedded Systems_ especially _embedded Linux Systems_.

Recent commercial projects include _industrial smart cameras_ and _industrial vision systems_ using _Yocto_ and other _embedded Linux_ systems, _embedded test farms_ with _hardware in the loop_ automation for _continuous integration_ and some _microcontroller projects_.

For freelance projects I can be reached via [email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}).
